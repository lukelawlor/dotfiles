* dotfiles

Here are the dotfiles for my various Linux setups. Below are some descriptions of the various directories here.

- tsm :: configs for my main user on my desktop named tsm (short for theSickMobile)
- firejailuser :: configs for my secondary user on my desktop for sandboxing games in firejail
- conterm :: configs for my main user on my laptop
- src :: configs for programs that are configured by editing source code (ex. dwm) I don't claim ownership over the source code for any of these programs
- bin :: miscellaneous scripts by me
