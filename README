Here are my dotfiles (configuration files) & miscellaneous bash
scripts for GNU/Linux.

The 'bash' directory contains my bash scripts.

2026.01.17 note: I haven't updated this repository with my most recent
dotfiles for a while, so I'll be restructuring it in the near
future. For now, my old dotfiles are in the 'old' directory.
